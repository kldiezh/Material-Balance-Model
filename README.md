## Material-Balance-Model

## This repository contains a Material Balance Model for shale oil reservoirs. The programming language used is Python. The workflow and equations are based on the paper: "Material Balance ## Forecast of Huff-and-Puff Gas Injection in Multiporosity Shale Oil Reservoirs" (SPE-189783-MS). This work is still in development. Please note that running the "Main" script executes the ## entire workflow.
